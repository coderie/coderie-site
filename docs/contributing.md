## Branches:
Please create a branch for any new features, hotfixes, etc and then submit a Pull Request(PR) for code review and approval by the group. Once tested and approved this branch will be merged into the development branch and tested along side cohort PR's before being pushed to master for production.


### Pull Requests: 
  
  For purposes of good documentation, when submitting a PR add screenshots of changes to the descriptions if you’re adding a feature, adding styles, etc . 
  
#### To take a screenshot:
  
  * On a Mac press `⌘` + `Shift` + `4` then drag a box over the desired area. The screenshot will be added to your desktop by default.  
  * On a Windows machine press `Windows key`+ `PrtScn` and the screen will dim for a moment when the screen is copied and saved as a file in the Screenshots folder (which is in your Pictures folder).
